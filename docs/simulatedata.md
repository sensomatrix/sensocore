# Simulate the ECG and EEG data


## Simulating ECG data

1. The user is required to select the ECG Simulation, which is situated at the top right of the SensoMatrix window. Screenshot provided below:

2. Once the ECG Simulation window is opened, the user will be able to configure the simulated signal. This will be done by changing the parameters of the P,Q,R,S and T wave, which are the main components of the ECG signal. In terms of these P,Q,R,S and T waves, there are corresponding magnitude, width and time. Screenshot provided below:

3. The user can also configure the signal properties, in a sense that it simulates a signal with added noise, or changing other parameters such as sampling frequency, period, total duration of the signal and to create a delay into the signal. The user can also change the signal name, in case they plan to work with multiple signals. Screenshot provided below:

 Example of a simulated ECG signal with total duration: 120 secs, delay: 2 secs, and noise: 0.0045.

## Simulating EEG data

1. The user is required to select the EEG Simulation, which is situated at the top right of the SensoMatrix window. Screenshot provided below:

2. Once the EEG Simulation window is opened, the user will be able to configure the simulated signal. This will be done by changing the C1 constant, which will dictate the brain wave that the signal will be presented as (e.g: alpha wave, beta wave and etc).**This C1 constant is derived from the Jansen Model.**

3. The user can also configure the signal properties, in a sense that it simulates a signal with added noise, or changing other parameters such as sampling frequency, period, total duration of the signal and to create a delay into the signal. The user can also change the signal name, in case they plan to work with multiple signals.

Example of a simulated EEG signal with total duration: 120 secs and noise: 1.00, with C1 constant: 135.
